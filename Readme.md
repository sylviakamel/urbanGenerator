# Mesh Generator (Assignment #2 Walkthrough)

  - Author: Sylvia Kamel



## How to run?

```
./run.sh
```

Generating Cities: Change the -cityCount command line argument next to the visualizer command in the run.sh file. This will generate cities only on land!

## rationale
I implemented the shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path between 2 given nodes. Simply change the number of cities by editing the run.sh file like mentioned above :D
